# BorschtBreakers
A Soviet-themed Russian Language Teaching game

I built this project back in Grade 10 for my AP Computer Science final project. 
We had to create a program that would teach a language to a prospective audience, so me and my russophone friend Daniel ([His Github here!](https://github.com/kashepavadan))
decided to teach Russian through the medium of a quiz game, designed to teach the very basics such as the Cyrillic alphabet, numbers, and basic nouns. 
The name of our project, "BorschtBreakers", is derived from the traditional slavic dish Borscht, which we used as a logo in our lessons.

BorschtBreakers teachs Russian through a series of lessons (slides written in HTML) with quizzes (defined in XML) on the content after each lesson. 
The game is designed this way in order to be extendable, with lessons and quizzes easily added to the program. Score data for each user is saved and put on a leaderboard, accessible in game.

# Instructions

### Installation
1. Open the "install" folder
2. Run the "install.bat" script
3. Select OK when prompted
4. BorschtBreakers should be installed in the "C:\BorschtBreakers" directory 

### Usage
 Information is given in the form of lessons (one lesson per topic), with information in a lesson divided between multiple "screens" of information for easier reading.
 After having read a lesson, the user must answer 10 questions based on the material that they learned – 5 multiple choice questions, and 5 free response questions.
 The user must have at least 5 questions right to advance.
 At the end of a game, the points must be at least 75% in order for the user to be declared a “Legend of Russia”.
